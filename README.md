## üîß Customization

You can easily customize the quiz by modifying the `quizData` array in the `script.js` file. Each question is an object within the array.

To add, remove, or change questions, edit this section in `script.js`:

```javascript
const quizData = [
    {
        question: "Which language runs in a web browser?",
        a: "Java",
        b: "C",
        c: "Python",
        d: "JavaScript",
        correct: "d",
    },
    {
        question: "What does CSS stand for?",
        a: "Central Style Sheets",
        b: "Cascading Style Sheets",
        c: "Cascading Simple Sheets",
        d: "Cars SUVs Sailboats",
        correct: "b",
    },
    // Add more question objects here...
];
```

-   **`question`**: The question text (string).
-   **`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`**: The answer options (strings).
-   **`correct`**: The key (`'a'`, `'b'`, `'c'`, or `'d'`) corresponding to the correct answer.
